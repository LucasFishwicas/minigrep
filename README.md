Project from [chapter 12](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html) of the rust-lang documentation

Developed by me in the zsh terminal (vim) as a means of practising new concepts learned directly from the [rust-lang book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

Concepts learned in previous (and future) chapters have been (and will be) practised through the use of the [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises - which I have been doing as I make my way through the book.
